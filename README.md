# TrainrPath
30 Day Workout Plan

TrainrPath is a fitness-oriented web application focused on structuring and organizing workout programs. This project was built as part of my developer portfolio to demonstrate practical front-end engineering skills, clean project architecture, and modern development workflows.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Practice modular, maintainable front-end development
- Apply component-based architecture
- Use Git & GitHub for real-world version control
- Build a foundation that can scale with additional features

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- Structured workout program layout
- Reusable UI components
- Responsive design principles
- Clean separation of concerns (logic, styling, structure)

---

## 🧩 Technical Stack
- **HTML5** – semantic markup
- **CSS3** – layout, responsiveness, and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – application logic
- **React.js** – component-based architecture for building reusable, state-driven user interfaces
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and collaboration

---

## 🗂️ Project Architecture
The project follows a scalable structure designed to support future growth:
src/
├── components/ # Reusable UI components
├── pages/ # Page-level components / routes
├── styles/ # Global and component-specific styles

This structure improves readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Concepts Demonstrated
- Component-based design
- State and UI separation
- Reusability and DRY principles
- Incremental development with Git commits
- Debugging and issue isolation

---

## 🧪 Development Workflow
- Local development using a modern dev server
- Git-based workflow for tracking changes
- Incremental commits to document progress
- Manual testing during development
